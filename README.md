- Compared single models (Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost) vs. Ensemble model (Stacking)
- Best model: Stacking Classifier – 99.96% accuracy, but slower training
- Fastest model: KNN – lowest accuracy but quickest (0.04 sec)
- Insight: Choose model based on trade-off between detection performance vs. speed
